# Team's Performance & Process Changes

## What worked well
Several strategies were implemented that worked well for us to ensure progress and team cohesion. 

Firstly, regular meetings were held with our partner every two weeks, which allowed for the reporting of progress and the exchange of advice and comments. This helped us to ensure that everyone was on the same page and that any potential issues could be addressed in a timely manner. 

Secondly, in-group meetings were conducted regularly, with most team members participating in discussions. This helped to facilitate collaboration and ensure that everyone's ideas and opinions were heard. 

Thirdly, whenever a problem was encountered, it was immediately posted in the group chat for discussion. Team members would then contribute their thoughts and suggestions, leading to the eventual resolution of the issue. Finally, clear work division was established, with each team member being responsible for their own parts. This helped to ensure accountability and prevent overlap or confusion regarding tasks. 

Throughout the project, these strategies proved effective in promoting communication, collaboration, and accountability within our team.

## What didn't work well
Due to having multiple coursework requirements outside of CSC301, we started the assignments later than anticipated. This led to time constraints and a need for more efficient collaboration to make up for lost time. Besides, some team members may have had ideas or suggestions that they considered to be "harsh" or critical, leading them to refrain from expressing them. However, it is important for all of us to encourage open communication and the sharing of all ideas, even those that may be initially difficult to hear, as they could ultimately help our team work more effectively. By addressing these challenges and fostering a culture of open communication, our team could work together more productively and efficiently.

## How we plan to continue working together
To expand on our plans for continued collaboration, we recognize that maintaining effective communication and collaboration will be key to the success of the project. As such, we plan to continue holding regular in-group meetings every Thursday to keep everyone on the same page and facilitate productive discussions. We also plan to maintain our reporting process to our partner to ensure that we are meeting expectations and receiving feedback as needed.

In addition, we will continue to address any problems encountered as a team, drawing on the diverse perspectives and expertise of each team member to find the best solutions. To manage our time effectively, we will have brief discussions together about the assignments once they are posted, allowing us to gain a general understanding of the task at hand. This will enable teammates with less urgent assignment dues to start earlier and make better use of their time.

Finally, we understand the importance of sharing thoughts and ideas to promote innovation and collaboration within the team. As such, we will continue to encourage each other to speak up and share their thoughts, whether about the development of the website or how we can work together more effectively as a team. This will allow us to leverage our collective strengths and experiences to achieve the best possible outcomes for the project. By maintaining these strategies and fostering a culture of open communication and collaboration, we are confident in our ability to work together productively and successfully.

## Analyze the demo to our partner and his feedback
## Front End
#### Demo reported to partner:
In a recent meeting with our partner, we presented our progress of Assignment 2 with demonstration of our deployed website, showcasing how the search function would work and how the internship project information would be displayed on the page. We also demonstrated the user experience when searching for a keyword, including the prompt to the search results page. In the event that no results were found, we made sure that the user would be directed back to the previous page where the search was initiated.

#### Feedback from partner:
Daniel recommended displaying one internship project per row, rather than three, as this would accommodate the potentially extensive information stored for each project. This suggestion is particularly helpful as it highlights the importance of considering the information architecture when designing the user interface. By taking into account what information is stored in the database, we can design an interface that maximizes usability and user experience.
