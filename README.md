# Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC), University of Toronto -- CSC301 MScAC
## Description
The project is a visualization and search interface for graduate internship abstracts. It is a web interface to display, filter, and search the public abstracts of the applied research internship projects carried out by students from the MScAC program at the University of Toronto. Our partner is Daniel Giovannini, the Associate Director for MScAC Partnerships. We are planning to build an interactive, searchable website that is both desktop- and mobile-friendly.

## Key Features
* The main page contains filter sections including year, organization and supervisor to provide a more time efficient way for users to filter out the target projects. When filtered by year, projects posted in that specific year would be listed. If filtered by organization, projects performed by such organization would be returned, and if filtered by academic supervisor, projects supervised by certain supervisor would be displayed.
* The search box allows full-text searching which would return the projects that contains the search terms.
* There are several tags listed below the search box that represents the current hot topics. For example, "machine learning" and "robotics" can be two of the popular tags being searched frequently.
* After the user has chosen a project and would like to check details about the supervisor or organization that held the project, simply click on the name of the supervisor or the organization, and the link would send the user to the specific page.
